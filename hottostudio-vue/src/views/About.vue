          Hottostudio is a multidisciplinary studio founded by Pierpaolo Di Giuseppe. It merges three different personalities, each with a different background, tied together by one language, approach and vision, which are based on personal research. We deal in graphic design and photography by offering  a cohesive synergy of visual identity,  communication strategy and creative direction. We walk hand in hand with our clients in order to reach their targets. Our clientele spans from major brands down to small start-ups.
          Hottostudioâ€™s headquarters are in Novara but its reach encompasses both Piedmont and Lombardy.
